# jmeter-openshift-jenkins

This repo includes the Jenkinsfile, OpenShift objects, Dockerfiles, and scripts to orchestrate running containerized JMeter tests from a Jenkins pipeline.

To use the [JMeter Reports Dashboard](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/generating-dashboard.html) and display it in Jenkins, [read this more recent blog post.](https://eleanordare.com/blog/2018/5/3/using-a-jenkins-pipeline-to-run-jmeter-tests-in-openshift-bkba6)

One other strategy is to use the [Performance Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Performance+Plugin) in Jenkins, but this doesn't give you as much detail. If you'd still prefer to use this plugin, the setup is in [this blog post here.](https://eleanordare.com/blog/2017/6/14/using-a-jenkins-pipeline-to-run-jmeter-tests-in-openshift)
